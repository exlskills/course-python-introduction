### Operations on variables and values

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

This means that you can use the operators to manipulate variables in the same way that we talked about in the last lecture.


Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators


- Since we already looked at the Arithmetic Operators in the previous lectures, I will gloss over them here

|Operator|Name|Example
|-|-|-|
|+|Addition|x + y|
|-|Subtraction|x - y
|*|Multiplication|x * y
|/|Division|x / y	|
|%|Modulus|x % y|
|**|Exponentiation|x ** y	 
|//|Floor division|x // y

       on
       a new line. Do not start the line with a `#`, otherwise your R code is not executed!&quot;)
       success_msg(&quot;Awesome! See how the console shows the result of the R code you
       submitted? Now that you&#39;re familiar with the interface, let&#39;s get down to R
       business!&quot;)
     </code>
     <div data-type="hint">
       <p>Just add a line of R code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, just like the
         example
         in the sample code!</p>
