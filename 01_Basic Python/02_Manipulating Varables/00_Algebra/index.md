### Operations in python

Just like a calculator, python works well with numbers.  You can add variables together if they are the same type!



There are a multitude of other mathematical functions that you can use.  

- `*` = Multiplication
  - Can be used with floats and integers

- `+` = Addition
  - Can be used with floats, integers and _strings_

- `-` = Subtraction
  - Can be used with floats and integers

- `/` = Division
  - Can be used with floats and integers



#### Other functions:

- `**` = Exponential

- `//` Integer Division
  - Integer division is division in which the fractional part (remainder) is discarded is called integer division.

- `%` Modulus Division
  - In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus)


## Examples in the interpreter!

```python
# Declare a string:

# Strings can be multiple letters
string1 = 'Hello World'

# Strings can hold a text representation of a number
string2 = "1"

# Strings can hold a text representation of multiple numbers
string3 = '1 2 3'

# Print each out
print(string1)
print(string2)
print(string3)
```
<!-- ```python

  # Declare variables x and y
  x = 2
  y = 3

  # Add x and y and print the result
  print('The sum of x and y is: ',x + y)

  # Subtract x and y and print the result
  print('The difference of x and y is: ', x - y)

  # Multiply x and y and print the result
  print('x * y equals: ', x * y)

  # Divide x and y and print the result
  print('x / y = ' x / y)

``` -->
