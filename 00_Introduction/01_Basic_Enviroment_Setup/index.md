### Where do I put python code?  

One of the most difficult parts of learning to code in python is setting up an environment to code in.  Even to this day, I struggle with this, and so I am going to provide you with a platform that will allow you to code directly on it and it has some higher level tutorials if you ever want to use python for **data science**.  

### Google Colab

Follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) to access a document that shows all of the features from Google Colab.  You will not need many of these features immediately, but it would be useful to familiarize yourself with the first couple of sections.

Once you have done this, I would recommend opening a new blank document by going to the **file** menu and choosing the option **new Python 3 notebook**.  Once you have done this, you can explore all the concepts that are presented in this course and gain a wide understanding of how to code in python.
